	<h2> About HSCTF</h2>
		<p>
			"HSCTF ("High School Capture the Flag") is the first CTF designed by high schoolers for high schoolers.

			Unlike other CTFs, HSCTF isn't purely about computer security. It extends the CTF model of competition to other areas of computer 
			science such as the design and analysis of algorithms and programming languages. Each challenge will still have a flag, and most of our challenges 
			will fall into the traditional CTF categories of cryptography, reverse engineering, programming languages, forensics, and recon.

			Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions are traditionally targeted at college students or industry professionals. HSCTF is a CTF designed for younger
			students who might be interested in computer science.

			Our primary goals are to educate students in computer science, and to increase their interest in computer science."
